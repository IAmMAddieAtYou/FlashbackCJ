**This is a fork of the original Flashback mod.**

Flashback is a Minecraft mod which allows you to record your Minecraft gameplay, play it back and create stunning cinematic shots.

**New Feature (in this fork): CJ Exporter**

This fork of Flashback includes a **CJ Exporter** feature. When you go to export your playback, you will find a new option to export a **CJ JSON** file alongside your cinematic. This JSON file contains all the camera information from your recorded playback, allowing for precise recreation of your camera movements in external tools.

**Blender Addon for CJ Import**

To further enhance your cinematic workflow, there is a Blender addon available that allows you to import these CJ JSON files directly into Blender: [https://github.com/IAmMAddieAtYou/Blender-Flashback-CJ-Importer](https://github.com/IAmMAddieAtYou/Blender-Flashback-CJ-Importer). This addon streamlines the process of using your Flashback camera data for advanced rendering and post-processing in Blender.
